Code used on Daniel Lemire's blog

by D. Lemire

blog: http://lemire.me/blog/



This code is meant to illustrate ideas
that I present on my blog. Don't expect or
ask for industrial-strength software. It is
experimental code: it can be wrong, slow, poorly
coded and poorly documented.

I do maintain some software meant for actual
use, with bona fide unit testing and documentation.
The code here does not fit in this category.
